This is an important part of coding: nobody has everything memorised, but we are all experts at Googling the information we need quickly. Search around, read pandas docs, stack overflow, medium, and anywhere else you find information. If you're totally stuck feel free to ask your \"colleagues\" (fellow students), your instructor, or one of our junior instructors. Most of the time though, we'll have taught you the answer in one of the previous notebooks, please check back in them too, they will be a great source of information throughout this
